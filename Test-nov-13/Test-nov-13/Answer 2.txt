  Types of  Variable
  1.Class variable
  2.Local varible

 1.class variables are declared inside class but outside a method.
   * Directly we can access the class variable any were  

 2.Local variables are declared inside method.
 * local variables are visible only within method so can access local method outside method.
 * There is no default value for local variable we intitialize before first use.


    Ex::
    public class Information
   {
       public static short age=23; //Class  Variable
      public static void main(String[] info)
     {
           String name="Vishalaxi";   //Local Variable
           System.out.println(name);
      }
  }
