    public static void main(String[]  system)
 {
      String[] osNames={ "Windows","linux","Apple"};
      int size=osNames.length();
      System.out.println("size of array::" +size);
      System.out.println("element at index 0::"  +osNames[0]);
       System.out.println("element at index 1::"  +osNames[2]);
       System.out.println("element at index 3::"  +osNames[3]);
}
